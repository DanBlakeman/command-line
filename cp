cp

This command is used in unix to copy files.

It generally takes two arguments (and many flags viewable on its man page):
  the file to be copied (inc path, if its not in current dir)
  the filename and path it is to be copied too.
  
Note, if no new filename is given, only a new path, the copied file will keep its original name!
