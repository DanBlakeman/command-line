wc

Used in unix to count words, lines, chars, or bytes in a given input.

Generally called with one argument:
  the file or input to be counted.
  
Will return the number of lines, words, and characters by default along with the file name.

To get only one of these outputs please use the relevant flag (viewable on it's man page).

Note: Combined with grep, wc can be useful for counting search results.
