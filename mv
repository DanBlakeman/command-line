mv

Used in unix to move or rename files.

Generally takes two arguments (and multiple flags viewable at 'man mv'):
  the file to be moved
  the new name it is to have and the path of its new location.

If a new name is not specified the files keeps its original name.

Note - If you move a file from its current dir, to the current dir, this command can be used to rename files. In fact its the most common way of renaming files!
